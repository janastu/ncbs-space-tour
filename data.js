Students from the time would discuss the disproportionate size of his lab, compared to other labs. The trainees would stay for three months to a few years, each getting a glimpse of a research life that would otherwise remain unknown to them.',

"During the time we were trying to find different ion channels that are present in Drosophila neurons at different stages of development. These were acute cultures of Drosophila larval and adult neurons kept in dishes for specific amounts of time. The cells were patched by the patch pipettes where the glass of the pipette forms a high resistance seal with the cell membrane so that no current can leak through the seal. This ensures that whatever current that is recorded by the patch pipette is a result of the channels that are present in the piece of membrane around which the high resistance seal is formed. If one destroys that piece of membrane by force, then the pipette is able access the whole cell and hence the currents then measured represent the combined activity of the whole cell." ',
